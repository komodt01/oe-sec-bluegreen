**Purpose:** This repository is a **reference implementation** that blends the AWS Well-Architected **Operational Excellence** and **Security** pillars with practical CI/CD guardrails.  
**Note:** Where we implement “AWS recommendations,” they are labeled as such. **These are not one-size-fits-all prescriptions**—the right choice depends on your business requirements and constraints. In some cases, **OpenStack** (or another provider) may be the better fit.

## What this repo is (and isn’t)

- **Is:** A scaffold you can clone to accelerate delivery with sensible defaults:
  - Blue/green deployment patterns (per AWS guidance).
  - CI/CD with linting, synth checks (where applicable), and **CodeQL** code scanning.
  - **Dependabot** dependency + security updates.
  - Branch protection patterns you can adopt/tune.

- **Is not:** A finished product for every workload. You’ll still tailor:
  - Platform choice (AWS, OpenStack, hybrid).
  - Service selection, network topology, IAM, data protections.
  - Compliance mappings and threat model depth.

---

## Why blue/green?

**AWS recommends** blue/green for safer releases with fast rollback. Commonly implemented with:
- **AWS CodeDeploy** (blue/green for EC2/ASG, Lambda, ECS).
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** (built-in blue/green swap for web apps).

If the workload or org constraints make AWS blue/green unsuitable, apply the same pattern on **OpenStack** (two pools behind a load balancer, health-gated cutover) or your chosen platform.

## Security posture (at a glance)

| Control Area                   | Reference Default Here | Rationale / Notes |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Code Scanning (CodeQL)         | Enabled (matrix by language) with **skip-logic** so non-target repos don’t fail PRs | Surfaces vulns in PRs and on `main`; skips if no matching language exists. |
| Dependency Updates             | **Dependabot** alerts + security updates | Reduce MTTR for vulnerable libs. |
| Secret Scanning (optional)     | Recommended (enable in repo Settings → Security) | Blocks leaked credentials early. |
| Branch Protections             | Require PRs + status checks; restrict force-push; linear history optional | Protects `main` and release tags. |
| CI Lint/Synth                  | Lightweight job (`lint-and-synth`) | Fast feedback before expensive stages. |
| SBOM / Artifact Signing (opt.) | Not included by default | Add Syft/CycloneDX + Sigstore if required. |

## CI/CD & guardrails

### CodeQL (reference defaults)
- Scans on PRs to `main`, pushes to `main`, and a weekly scheduled run.
- Uses a language matrix (Python/JavaScript) and **skips** when no files match.

### Dependabot
- Security updates enabled to reduce exposure window.

### Branch protection (recommended)
- Require PRs
- Require checks:
  - `ci / lint-and-synth`
  - `Code scanning results / CodeQL`
- Restrict force-push
- Optional: Require approvals

## Cloud choice & portability

- **AWS**: Reference implementations for CodeDeploy and Beanstalk.
- **OpenStack**: Equivalent load balancer–based pattern.

Choose based on **business requirements**: cost, RTO/RPO, data residency, and compliance scope.
